# amazonclone
Basic Amazon Clone usiing React and context api. 
The idea was to recreate amazon's site using React. 
This application is deployed using Firebase.
The user needs to create an account before being able to add any products to the cart. 
In the future I will be looking at adding more functionality like payments and sliding images on the homepage.
